Use case:
modernize batch processing while minimizing adoption risk and preserving existing investments. Scenarios that traditionally rely on scheduled batch processing, such as transaction reconciliation, face a number of typical challenges:
- high latency - there is an inherent time gap between data availability and processing;
- security and reliability risks of traditional file sharing infrastructure and protocols (shared folders, FTP/SFTP)
- scaling due to sequential execution of batch jobs;

We will show how to create a solution that:
- minimizes operational risk through the use of highly available storage, with seamlessly integrated security controls
- reduces latency by using the event-driven capabilities of the storage layer
- increases throughput by parallelizing data processing while observing data affinity limitations
- reduces operational cost and complexity via on-demand business logic execution and elastic scaling.
